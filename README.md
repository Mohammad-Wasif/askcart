Chatbot Workflow ‚Äì End-to-End
1. Integration & Setup
Store owner installs the chatbot plugin or adds the script.


Store API keys are connected to access product catalog, order data, and customer information.


2. Data Sync
Product catalog, sales history, and customer reviews are synced to the chatbot database.


Vector embeddings are created for semantic search, personalization, and recommendations.


3. Customer Interaction
User opens the chat widget and submits a natural language query.


Query is sent to the backend API gateway with session context and user metadata attached.


4. Real-Time Query Processing
Step 1: Intent Recognition & Data Retrieval
NLP/LLM engine parses query for intent and entities.


Vector database performs semantic search on the product catalog.


Sales database provides popularity, trends, and performance data.
